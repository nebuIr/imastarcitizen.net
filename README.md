Imastarcitizen.net website
==========================

This is my just for fun project. 
I created this website mostly for testing purposes and for learning HTML, CSS and PHP.

Therfore the structure and coding might not be perfect.
I'm already working a long time on this project, so I thought I will use GitHub for my work from now on. It makes it a lot easier for me.
